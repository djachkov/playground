            I live and work in Saint-Petersburg, Russia.
            Love programming, DevOps and all relative stuff.
            I'm experienced a little in Python development and currently employed as a DevOps engineer at Itiviti.
            As a backend for this page, I'm using a Go language.

                    Hello, everyone! <br>
                    I would talk a little about development progress. Here, I would tell you about every step, this website will be go through. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all, frontend part of this website is just a naked html page written from scratch, without any css or even good structure. 
                    As a backend, I decided to use Go, as it is a good opportunity to learn this language a little bit more.
                    It shows, that it is really easy to make a simple web server on the golang. It takes less, than 30 lines of code and goes out of the box.
